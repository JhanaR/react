//loops are a way to repeat the same code to a number of times.
//increment/decrement condition should present for loop 
//initialization, condition, increment/decrement are at different place and not in organized compared to for loop
//i want to print 1 to 10 usingwhile loop


let i=0;//initialize
while(i < 3){//condition
  i++;//increment
  console.log(i);
}
