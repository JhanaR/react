<!-- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

    The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
    
    The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. -->
